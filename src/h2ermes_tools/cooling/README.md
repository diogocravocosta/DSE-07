# Heat Shield Cooling Simulation Explanation

Run the `run.py` file. This file provides high-level control over the simulation. Most of the logic is implemented in `heat_transfer.py`.

There are three other heat transfer files: `simple_heat_transfer.py`, `better_heat_transfer.py`, `steady_state_heat_transfer.py`. These are kept in the repository to document the progress of the simulation and its accuracy as more features were added.

`steady_state_heat_transfer.py` file uses an analytical solution to find the final heat distribution on the heat shield.
